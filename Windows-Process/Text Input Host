TextInputHost.exe seems to be part of Windows Feature Experience Pack Known as Windows System File or UX.Client.ST.
TextInputHost.exe enables the text input process in the (UWP) Universal Windows Platform.
This should allow to enter information into UWP applications and there if we disable it would 
prevent us from entering information into these UWP associated applications

# Need to test what disabling this would affect.
