The command line for this is :

5688 - this is the parent process ID of consent.exe which is svchost.exe
648 - this is the process ID for wininit.exe

For the parent from the log we have the following information:

"COMMAND_LINE": "C:\\Windows\\system32\\svchost.exe -k netsvcs -p -s Appinfo"
"FILE_IS_SIGNED": 1
"FILE_PATH": "C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe"
"PROCESS_ID": 5688
"USER_NAME":"NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"
svchost.exe - usually see many instance of this process open

"FILE_IS_SIGNED": 1
"PARENT_PROCESS_ID": 648
"PROCESS_ID": 768
"USER_NAME":"NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"

"FILE_IS_SIGNED": 1
"PARENT_PROCESS_ID": 536
"PROCESS_ID": 648
"USER_NAME": "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"
wininit.exe - only 1 instance at a time

wininit.exe - Parent process is smss.exe which after the child process is created exits
smss.exe - Parent process is System 
Path: %SystemRoot%\System32\smss.exe

System - is ran by local system with 1 system that starts at boot time
