# Notes about Touch Keyboard and Handwriting Panel (TabTip.exe) 
# Windows 11 vm Version 22H2 (OS Build 22621.1992) on VMware® Workstation 17 Pro (Version - 17.0.0 build-20800274)

Trying to learn more about the built-in windows virtual keyboards and how they show in logs 
we'll be looking at TabTip which we can find here :
C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\ink\TabTip.exe

Description: Touch Keyboard and Handwriting Panel
I was able to generate this log by manually running TabTip.exe and Lima Charlie was able to collect it as a NEW_PROCESS event
We we look at one of the log's and trace it back as far as we can

The command line for this in the logs shows as:
"\"C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\microsoft shared\\ink\\TabTip.exe\" "
"FILE_IS_SIGNED": 1
"FILE_PATH": "C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\ink\TabTip.exe"
"PARENT_PROCESS_ID": 5688
"PROCESS_ID": 9240

Let's look at the parent process - svchost
"FILE_PATH": "C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe"
"FILE_IS_SIGNED": 1
"PROCESS_ID": 5688
"PARENT_PROCESS_ID":768
"USER_NAME": "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"

We can now look at svchost.exe Parent process which is services.exe

"FILE_PATH": "\Device\HarddiskVolume4\Windows\System32\services.exe"
"FILE_IS_SIGNED": 1
"PARENT_PROCESS_ID": 648
"PROCESS_ID": 768
"USER_NAME":"NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"
services.exe - only 1 instance at a time

Now let's look at services.exe Parent process which is wininit.exe

"FILE_PATH": "\Device\HarddiskVolume4\Windows\System32\wininit.exe"
"FILE_IS_SIGNED": 1
"PARENT_PROCESS_ID": 536
"PROCESS_ID": 648
"USER_NAME": "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"
wininit.exe - only 1 instance at a time

wininit.exe - Parent process is smss.exe which after the child process is created exits
smss.exe - Parent process is System 
Path: %SystemRoot%\System32\smss.exe

# More information to be added over time as I learn more
# This information was gathered from logs (Lima Charlie) and used SANS DFIR hunt evil poster as reference for process information (https://www.sans.org/posters/hunt-evil/)
