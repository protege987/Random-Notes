# Notes about On-screen keyboard (osk.exe) 
# Windows 11 vm Version 22H2 (OS Build 22621.1992) on VMwareÂ® Workstation 17 Pro (Version - 17.0.0 build-20800274)

While trying to learn about SetWindowsHookExA function or similar hooking mechanisms, I tried to open the windows virtual keyboard to see if this will trigger
it to show in logs. Failed but we now have oak.exe which is the on-screen keyboard. So let's explore this while being sad that coffee is done.

The command line and the file path for this will show as : 
"C:\\Windows\\system32\\osk.exe"
"FILE_IS_SIGNED":1
"PROCESS_ID": 6388
"PARENT_PROCESS_ID": 5688
"USER_NAME":"WINDEV\User" (runs as user that open's program)

If the On-Screen keyboard properties are check the target shows as follows : 
%windir%\system32\osk.exe

Description : 
Accessibility On-Screen Keyboard

Parent process information: 
svchost.exe
"PROCESS_ID":5688
"COMMAND_LINE": "C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe -k netsvcs -p -s Appinfo"
"FILE_IS_SIGNED": 1
"FILE_PATH":"C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe"
"USER_NAME": "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"

We can now look at svchost.exe Parent process which is services.exe

"FILE_PATH": "\Device\HarddiskVolume4\Windows\System32\services.exe"
"FILE_IS_SIGNED": 1
"PARENT_PROCESS_ID": 648
"PROCESS_ID": 768
"USER_NAME":"NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"
services.exe - only 1 instance at a time

Now let's look at services.exe Parent process which is wininit.exe

"FILE_PATH": "\Device\HarddiskVolume4\Windows\System32\wininit.exe"
"FILE_IS_SIGNED": 1
"PARENT_PROCESS_ID": 536
"PROCESS_ID": 648
"USER_NAME": "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM"
wininit.exe - only 1 instance at a time

wininit.exe - Parent process is smss.exe which after the child process is created exits
smss.exe - Parent process is System 
Path: %SystemRoot%\System32\smss.exe

System - is ran by local system with 1 system that starts at boot time

# More information to be added over time as I learn more
# This information was gathered from logs (Lima Charlie) and used SANS DFIR hunt evil poster as reference for process information (https://www.sans.org/posters/hunt-evil/)
