# Notes about MoUsoCoreWorker.exe
# Windows 11 vm Version 22H2 (OS Build 22621.1992) on VMwareÂ® Workstation 17 Pro (Version - 17.0.0 build-20800274)

We will be looking at the MoUsoCoreWorker.exe which I found randomly while looking at logs in Lima Charlie
This process is related to windows update Unified Update Platform (UUP) . Not able to find much details regarding this
only bits and pieces. USOCoreWorker.exe, MoUsoCoreWorker.exe and wuauclt.exe are all related with the windows
update processes. 
soapi.dll, usocoreps.dll, and usosvc.dll are all related DLL files that are used by the Unified Update Platform (UUP) to manage Windows updates
This information was found through google searches and several random posts but nothing with full details

This post has some information :

Will create separate entries on each process if I able to find them in logs and trace them back

Looking at the properties of binary in file explorer
