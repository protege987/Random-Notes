# Notes about appidcertstorecheck.exe

Found this one in the logs randomly as usual while procrastinating in Lima Charlie
As usual another windows process that information is hard to find on

This file contained a list of applications that were allowed to run on Windows. AppIdPolicyConverter.exe would check the

AppIdPolicyConverter.exe seems to have been replaced by Windows 8 for appidcertstorecheck.exe. Since AppIdPolicyConverter.exe it was 
using a AppIdPolicy.xml file this could be modified as a text file made it not as secure compared to appidcertstorecheck.exe
which is stored in a database (AppIdStore.db)

AppIdStore.db is stored in C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\AppRepository
This folder even if your using a local admin account you are not able to access. To access it
